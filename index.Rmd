## Bio

I am a research assistant in the [Yu-Chao Wang Lab](https://yuchao.web.nycu.edu.tw/) at [National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University](https://www.nycu.edu.tw/nycu/ch/index). In the lab, I am studying lung cancer through integrating multi-omics and machine learning approaches.

During my master's I studied host virus interaction, specifically through the post translational modification ADP-ribosylation, of SARS-CoV-2, Chikungunya, and Influenza with [Anthony Leung](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/2498/anthony-k-l-leung) at the [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/).
